Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67248457", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and what is Hamas?", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes.

He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67201107", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Gaza Strip in maps: Life in Gaza under siege", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Could an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67084141", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israeli troops clear Gaza areas 'slice by slice', but is this an invasion?", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services.

But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known.

All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67205109", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Gaza hospital blast: What does new analysis tell us?", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67216929", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza tells of 'terror' for family", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67269089", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Moment injured Gaza girl, 5, sees baby sister is alive", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received.

All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67268584", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "What China wants from Israel-Hamas war", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-67237146", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Reporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory.

We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known.

But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop.

Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop.

Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received.

We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us.

But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile.

Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67268154", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Cornell University boosts security after antisemitic threats", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults. She wanted to make a career in social work.\"Mrs Brisley said while she could not hold a tune, Noiya loved to dance and sing.\"To make us laugh she would sing at the top of her voice, and chase us round the kitchen. What a dreadful voice but a great dancer,\" she added.Mrs Brisley said she last saw her daughter and grandchildren in July, after they attended Yahel's Bat Mitzvah, where they spent their two-week holiday \"playing in the pool\" and \"playing silly games\".\"The whole family was together,\" she said.Unable to travel for the funeral, the family said they said their goodbyes by watching videos of the service on WhatsApp. \"There were hundreds of people there.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67267707", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Paul Bristow: Ministerial aide sacked after call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictA large number of opposition MPs have backed calls for a ceasefire but very few Conservative MPs have. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67264814", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOver the weekend, Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the \"second stage\" of a war intended to destroy Hamas, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,300 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low.Mr Netanyahu has also rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that to pause military operations would be \"to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism\".\"Today we draw a line between the forces of civilisation and the forces of barbarism,\" he told a news conference on Monday. \"Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory. I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67261366", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Two women arrested in London on suspicion of terrorism offences", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I am grateful to the public who have reported information to us and I urge anyone who has information about the man and woman we are still seeking to please let us know. \"If the people in the pictures recognise themselves, I urge them to come forward so we can speak with them.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again.

Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services.

But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.\"He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.\"I hug you,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had \"nearly stopped beating\" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to \"make every possible effort to bring them home\".Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysOn 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for \"humanitarian reasons\".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City.

A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I am grateful to the public who have reported information to us and I urge anyone who has information about the man and woman we are still seeking to please let us know. \"If the people in the pictures recognise themselves, I urge them to come forward so we can speak with them.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.\"He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.\"I hug you,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had \"nearly stopped beating\" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to \"make every possible effort to bring them home\".Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysOn 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for \"humanitarian reasons\".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said. An Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October has been rescued, Israel's military has said.Pte Ori Megidish was freed during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night and was reunited with her family, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.They added that she had undergone medical checks and was \"doing well\", but gave no details of her release.She is the fifth hostage to be released and the first soldier.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I am grateful to the public who have reported information to us and I urge anyone who has information about the man and woman we are still seeking to please let us know. \"If the people in the pictures recognise themselves, I urge them to come forward so we can speak with them.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.\"He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.\"I hug you,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had \"nearly stopped beating\" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to \"make every possible effort to bring them home\".Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysOn 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for \"humanitarian reasons\".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said. An Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October has been rescued, Israel's military has said.Pte Ori Megidish was freed during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night and was reunited with her family, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.They added that she had undergone medical checks and was \"doing well\", but gave no details of her release.She is the fifth hostage to be released and the first soldier.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Two Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been named by the Israeli government. Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga were in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme, Israel's foreign ministry said on X.\"They were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and are being held hostage in Gaza,\" the statement read. Mr Mollel's father told the BBC he has hope that his eldest son will return safely.Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has assured both families the two governments were working together to secure their release.However, the Tanzanian authorities have not commented publicly on the seizure of their citizens.Before it was confirmed that his son, 21, had been taken hostage, Mr Mollel told the BBC he couldn't eat or sleep because he was desperate to know what had happened to him.\"When I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,\" he said last week. The last time Mr Mollel spoke to his son was on Thursday 5 October - two days before the Hamas gunmen attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz, where he was studying. The last words he said were: \"Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.\"Mr Mtenga's sister told the BBC they were worried about him but remained hopeful they would be rescued.The family say they have been in contact with Mr Mtenge's roommate who managed to avoid being captured by Hamas, and keeps them informed about the situation in Israel.They had one message for the 22-year-old: \"He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon.\"They were among 260 Tanzanian students in Israel.On 7 October 1,400 people were massacred by Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - in Israel. More than 230 hostages were taken over the border to the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas control.Israel says they come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified.The South African authorities have not commented.Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in \"safe places and tunnels\" within Gaza.Four of the hostages have since been released, including Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from a different kibbutz. During the handover she shook the hand of her Hamas captor. She said she had been beaten with sticks while being taken to Gaza but had otherwise been well treated. Since the attack, Israel has retaliated with air strikes that have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflict", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67260313", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Pro-Palestinian protests: Met Commissioner calls for clarity", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families.

Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said. An Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October has been rescued, Israel's military has said.Pte Ori Megidish was freed during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night and was reunited with her family, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.They added that she had undergone medical checks and was \"doing well\", but gave no details of her release.She is the fifth hostage to be released and the first soldier. At least 238 people are still being held.\"PVT Megidish was abducted by Hamas on October 7.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Two Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been named by the Israeli government. Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga were in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme, Israel's foreign ministry said on X.\"They were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and are being held hostage in Gaza,\" the statement read. Mr Mollel's father told the BBC he has hope that his eldest son will return safely.Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has assured both families the two governments were working together to secure their release.However, the Tanzanian authorities have not commented publicly on the seizure of their citizens.Before it was confirmed that his son, 21, had been taken hostage, Mr Mollel told the BBC he couldn't eat or sleep because he was desperate to know what had happened to him.\"When I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,\" he said last week. The last time Mr Mollel spoke to his son was on Thursday 5 October - two days before the Hamas gunmen attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz, where he was studying. The last words he said were: \"Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.\"Mr Mtenga's sister told the BBC they were worried about him but remained hopeful they would be rescued.The family say they have been in contact with Mr Mtenge's roommate who managed to avoid being captured by Hamas, and keeps them informed about the situation in Israel.They had one message for the 22-year-old: \"He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon.\"They were among 260 Tanzanian students in Israel.On 7 October 1,400 people were massacred by Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - in Israel. More than 230 hostages were taken over the border to the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas control.Israel says they come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified.The South African authorities have not commented.Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in \"safe places and tunnels\" within Gaza.Four of the hostages have since been released, including Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from a different kibbutz. During the handover she shook the hand of her Hamas captor. She said she had been beaten with sticks while being taken to Gaza but had otherwise been well treated. Since the attack, Israel has retaliated with air strikes that have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has called for clarity from the government on extremism, as he faces criticism over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests in London.Five people have been charged after being arrested at the demonstrations in central London on Saturday.The home secretary urged a \"zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism\".Sir Mark said about 100 people had been arrested at protests since the Hamas attack on Israel three weeks ago.He added that \"many more\" arrests are expected in the near future.Nine people were arrested in central London during a mainly peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday, which was attended by at least 100,000 people calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.Responding to Sir Mark's comments, Ms Braverman said some people who were protesting were \"chanting for the erasure of Israel\".She said police were concerned about a \"large number of bad actors deliberately operating beneath the criminal threshold\" at the protests.Noting that police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent, Ms Braverman said: \"They need to make those decisions based on the facts and evidence as they see them. But I have made my views clear, these are hate marches and the police must take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.\"Thousands at pro-Palestinian protest in LondonPro-Palestinian marches take place across UKSince Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 230 back to Gaza as hostages, Israel has responded with a retaliatory bombing campaign and ground operation.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks. In an update on Sunday night, the Met said a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman have been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, a 51-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy were charged with public order offences while a 41-year-old man was charged with causing actual bodily harm.Sir Mark said his officers are limited by legal definitions of extremism and that he would support a review into the definition and how it should be policed.\"There is scope to be much sharper in how we deal with extremism within this country. The law was never designed to deal with extremism, there's a lot to do with terrorism and hate crime but we don't have a body of law that deals with extremism, and that is creating a gap.\"He said lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service are working in the police operations room to help identify offences.\"We've got these big protests and some of what goes on there, people do find it upsetting and distasteful and sometimes people give an instinctive view that must not be legal.\"But there's no point arresting hundreds of people if it's not prosecutable, that's just inflaming things.\"We will robustly enforce up to the line of the law. We're going to be absolutely ruthless, and we have been, and you'll see many more arrests over the next week or so.\"Meanwhile, an education minister has said he agreed with the sentiment recently expressed by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem that London has a problem with antisemitism.Speaking on LBC, Robert Halfon, who is Jewish, warned it is a \"fearful time for Jews in the UK\", adding there is also a problem of \"ever-increasing incidents of antisemitism\" in universities.  After Mr Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the ongoing situation and its impact on communities in the UK, a Downing Street spokesman expressed concern at an increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.Speaking to reporters, the PM's spokesman described videos and pictures shared on social media over the weekend as \"extremely concerning\" and insisted that the government was working to reassure affected communities.Asked about calls for clarity on the definition of extremism, Downing Street said the government would look at any gaps in the law that might exist. \"It's important that frontline officers feel they have certainty and clarity,\" the spokesman added, but he also insisted that the police did have powers to act.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, \"disconnected from the planet\".Additional reporting by Muath Al KhatibThe parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found \"all cuddled together\".Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October.Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a \"devoted mother\" who \"tried to protect her daughters to the end\".\"Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms.\"Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yahel just days after their funeral.\"Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,\" Mrs Brisley said.Describing Lianne as a \"wonderful\" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a \"very friendly\" and \"a lovely place to bring up a family\".\"Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,\" she said.That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before.Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV.\"I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,\" he said.\"I think by then she had already gone.\"Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.\"Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier \"all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end\".\"A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,\" she added.\"I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping.

She had started scuba diving lessons and \"never sat still\".\"She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,\" she said.\"Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages.The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source.One post from a commenter named \"hamas\" was titled \"if i see another jew\". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.\"He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.\"I hug you,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had \"nearly stopped beating\" when he saw her picture.

Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said. An Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October has been rescued, Israel's military has said.Pte Ori Megidish was freed during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night and was reunited with her family, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.They added that she had undergone medical checks and was \"doing well\", but gave no details of her release.She is the fifth hostage to be released and the first soldier.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Two Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been named by the Israeli government. Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga were in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme, Israel's foreign ministry said on X.\"They were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and are being held hostage in Gaza,\" the statement read. Mr Mollel's father told the BBC he has hope that his eldest son will return safely.Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has assured both families the two governments were working together to secure their release.However, the Tanzanian authorities have not commented publicly on the seizure of their citizens.Before it was confirmed that his son, 21, had been taken hostage, Mr Mollel told the BBC he couldn't eat or sleep because he was desperate to know what had happened to him.\"When I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,\" he said last week. The last time Mr Mollel spoke to his son was on Thursday 5 October - two days before the Hamas gunmen attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz, where he was studying. The last words he said were: \"Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.\"Mr Mtenga's sister told the BBC they were worried about him but remained hopeful they would be rescued.The family say they have been in contact with Mr Mtenge's roommate who managed to avoid being captured by Hamas, and keeps them informed about the situation in Israel.They had one message for the 22-year-old: \"He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon.\"They were among 260 Tanzanian students in Israel.On 7 October 1,400 people were massacred by Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - in Israel. More than 230 hostages were taken over the border to the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas control.Israel says they come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified.The South African authorities have not commented.Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in \"safe places and tunnels\" within Gaza.Four of the hostages have since been released, including Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from a different kibbutz. During the handover she shook the hand of her Hamas captor. She said she had been beaten with sticks while being taken to Gaza but had otherwise been well treated. Since the attack, Israel has retaliated with air strikes that have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has called for clarity from the government on extremism, as he faces criticism over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests in London.Five people have been charged after being arrested at the demonstrations in central London on Saturday.The home secretary urged a \"zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism\".Sir Mark said about 100 people had been arrested at protests since the Hamas attack on Israel three weeks ago.He added that \"many more\" arrests are expected in the near future.Nine people were arrested in central London during a mainly peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday, which was attended by at least 100,000 people calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.Responding to Sir Mark's comments, Ms Braverman said some people who were protesting were \"chanting for the erasure of Israel\".She said police were concerned about a \"large number of bad actors deliberately operating beneath the criminal threshold\" at the protests.Noting that police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent, Ms Braverman said: \"They need to make those decisions based on the facts and evidence as they see them. But I have made my views clear, these are hate marches and the police must take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.\"Thousands at pro-Palestinian protest in LondonPro-Palestinian marches take place across UKSince Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 230 back to Gaza as hostages, Israel has responded with a retaliatory bombing campaign and ground operation.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks. In an update on Sunday night, the Met said a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman have been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, a 51-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy were charged with public order offences while a 41-year-old man was charged with causing actual bodily harm.Sir Mark said his officers are limited by legal definitions of extremism and that he would support a review into the definition and how it should be policed.\"There is scope to be much sharper in how we deal with extremism within this country. The law was never designed to deal with extremism, there's a lot to do with terrorism and hate crime but we don't have a body of law that deals with extremism, and that is creating a gap.\"He said lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service are working in the police operations room to help identify offences.\"We've got these big protests and some of what goes on there, people do find it upsetting and distasteful and sometimes people give an instinctive view that must not be legal.\"But there's no point arresting hundreds of people if it's not prosecutable, that's just inflaming things.\"We will robustly enforce up to the line of the law. We're going to be absolutely ruthless, and we have been, and you'll see many more arrests over the next week or so.\"Meanwhile, an education minister has said he agreed with the sentiment recently expressed by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem that London has a problem with antisemitism.Speaking on LBC, Robert Halfon, who is Jewish, warned it is a \"fearful time for Jews in the UK\", adding there is also a problem of \"ever-increasing incidents of antisemitism\" in universities.  After Mr Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the ongoing situation and its impact on communities in the UK, a Downing Street spokesman expressed concern at an increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.Speaking to reporters, the PM's spokesman described videos and pictures shared on social media over the weekend as \"extremely concerning\" and insisted that the government was working to reassure affected communities.Asked about calls for clarity on the definition of extremism, Downing Street said the government would look at any gaps in the law that might exist. \"It's important that frontline officers feel they have certainty and clarity,\" the spokesman added, but he also insisted that the police did have powers to act.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hello.bbclondon@bbc.co.ukIsrael's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67084141", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Shani Louk: Woman missing after Hamas attack is dead, says mother", "content": "A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background.\"The situation is very dangerous,\" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a \"collapse in connectivity\" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. \"Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,\" he said.\"Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones.\"Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as \"brutal\".\"We didn't expect that we would see morning,\" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit \"streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach\".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as \"catastrophic\".\"We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,\" he said.\"When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas.\"Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was \"standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy\", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population \"in grave danger\". \"Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk said. \"Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation.\" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again.

Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza,  in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to \"dismantle\" Hamas and bring hostages home.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it\". A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to set out his position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid growing tensions within the party over the conflict.In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir is expected to restate his support for \"a humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.But he will argue a permanent ceasefire would leave Hamas with the capability to carry out more attacks.A number of senior Labour figures have backed calls for a full ceasefire. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceSir Keir's aides say his speech will allow him to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict. He will focus on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a Palestinian state existing side by side.This position also allows him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And it will be a reminder to Labour members that the party can only make a difference if it gets in to power.But his speech won't - and can't - ignore not just the current war in the Middle East, but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy. He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He is expected to say he understands the desire for a ceasefire but to argue that a permanent ceasefire at this stage would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out more attacks similar to those of 7 October, in which more than 1,400 were killed.Instead, Sir Keir will repeat calls for \"a humanitarian pause\".By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. However, Sir Keir is expected to say a humanitarian pause could also enable diplomatic progress to be made.The Labour leader is also expected to say that Israel has a right to keep its people safe, within the guidelines of international law, as well as saying vital services in Gaza must be switched on, aid must be ramped up, Israel's military operation must be measured and civilians not permanently displaced.But, crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks will be sympathetic.He may have little choice, as otherwise he'd have to sack 13 junior shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.\"We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,\" he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.

In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison.Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a \"National Day of Jihad\" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (\u00a3800) from a bank account.According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: \"Let's pray for peace\". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife.She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand.The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month. Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an \"expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world\". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is \"a deeply offensive chant to many.\"Mr McDonald said he was \"saddened\" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been \"a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media\", which had \"furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me\".He added that his words \"should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence\".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".\"The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was \"unjust\" and \"absolutely nonsensical\". \"He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,\" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension \"an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine\".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as \"obscene and deeply offensive\". \"The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,\" the group said in a statement.\"The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in \"hate marches\". \"We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,\" Mrs Braverman said.\"To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.\"Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using \"rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder\". \"Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,\" she said. \"At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time.\"Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students.Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts.\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said.It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses.New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday.She said that \"we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred\".The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions.The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank.

The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people.Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had \"increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups\".Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which \"were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility\". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said \"a permanent ceasefire\" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports \"humanitarian pauses\" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said \"specific pauses\" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: \"I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. \"But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  \"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.\"Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country \"will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas\".\"Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: \"My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. \"Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.\"It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.\"He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians \"should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas\". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made \"deeply offensive\" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be \"doing well\", as an \"exciting achievement\" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as \"cruel psychological propaganda\" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.

I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.\"Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. \"He's gone, the whole family is gone,\" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: \"Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks.\" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.\"We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,\" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.\"While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.\"Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 \"terror targets\" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Tal al-Hawa also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were \"occupying each square metre\" of Al-Shifa and that it was \"overwhelmed\" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. \"But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.\"The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. \"The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,\" he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how \"the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break\". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was \"not going to meet the requirements of Gaza\". \"We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,\" he added. \"But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.\"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal.The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures.They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation.The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman.She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said.The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: \"I fully support Hamas\" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I am grateful to the public who have reported information to us and I urge anyone who has information about the man and woman we are still seeking to please let us know. \"If the people in the pictures recognise themselves, I urge them to come forward so we can speak with them.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: \"This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].\"We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.\"He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.\"I hug you,\" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had \"nearly stopped beating\" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to \"make every possible effort to bring them home\".Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysOn 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for \"humanitarian reasons\".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the \"anguish\" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. \"Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,\" he said. An Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October has been rescued, Israel's military has said.Pte Ori Megidish was freed during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night and was reunited with her family, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.They added that she had undergone medical checks and was \"doing well\", but gave no details of her release.She is the fifth hostage to be released and the first soldier. At least 238 people are still being held.\"PVT Megidish was abducted by Hamas on October 7. Tonight, she was released during IDF ground operations,\" the IDF said.\"Ori is now home with her family.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas launched an attack on southern Israel more than three weeks ago, killing more than 1,400 people and taking dozens more hostage. They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Two Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been named by the Israeli government. Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga were in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme, Israel's foreign ministry said on X.\"They were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and are being held hostage in Gaza,\" the statement read. Mr Mollel's father told the BBC he has hope that his eldest son will return safely.Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has assured both families the two governments were working together to secure their release.However, the Tanzanian authorities have not commented publicly on the seizure of their citizens.Before it was confirmed that his son, 21, had been taken hostage, Mr Mollel told the BBC he couldn't eat or sleep because he was desperate to know what had happened to him.\"When I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,\" he said last week. The last time Mr Mollel spoke to his son was on Thursday 5 October - two days before the Hamas gunmen attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz, where he was studying. The last words he said were: \"Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.\"Mr Mtenga's sister told the BBC they were worried about him but remained hopeful they would be rescued.The family say they have been in contact with Mr Mtenge's roommate who managed to avoid being captured by Hamas, and keeps them informed about the situation in Israel.They had one message for the 22-year-old: \"He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon.\"They were among 260 Tanzanian students in Israel.On 7 October 1,400 people were massacred by Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - in Israel. More than 230 hostages were taken over the border to the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas control.Israel says they come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified.The South African authorities have not commented.Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in \"safe places and tunnels\" within Gaza.Four of the hostages have since been released, including Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from a different kibbutz. During the handover she shook the hand of her Hamas captor. She said she had been beaten with sticks while being taken to Gaza but had otherwise been well treated. Since the attack, Israel has retaliated with air strikes that have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has called for clarity from the government on extremism, as he faces criticism over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests in London.Five people have been charged after being arrested at the demonstrations in central London on Saturday.The home secretary urged a \"zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism\".Sir Mark said about 100 people had been arrested at protests since the Hamas attack on Israel three weeks ago.He added that \"many more\" arrests are expected in the near future.Nine people were arrested in central London during a mainly peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday, which was attended by at least 100,000 people calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.Responding to Sir Mark's comments, Ms Braverman said some people who were protesting were \"chanting for the erasure of Israel\".She said police were concerned about a \"large number of bad actors deliberately operating beneath the criminal threshold\" at the protests.Noting that police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent, Ms Braverman said: \"They need to make those decisions based on the facts and evidence as they see them. But I have made my views clear, these are hate marches and the police must take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.\"Thousands at pro-Palestinian protest in LondonPro-Palestinian marches take place across UKSince Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 230 back to Gaza as hostages, Israel has responded with a retaliatory bombing campaign and ground operation.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks. In an update on Sunday night, the Met said a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman have been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, a 51-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy were charged with public order offences while a 41-year-old man was charged with causing actual bodily harm.Sir Mark said his officers are limited by legal definitions of extremism and that he would support a review into the definition and how it should be policed.\"There is scope to be much sharper in how we deal with extremism within this country. The law was never designed to deal with extremism, there's a lot to do with terrorism and hate crime but we don't have a body of law that deals with extremism, and that is creating a gap.\"He said lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service are working in the police operations room to help identify offences.\"We've got these big protests and some of what goes on there, people do find it upsetting and distasteful and sometimes people give an instinctive view that must not be legal.\"But there's no point arresting hundreds of people if it's not prosecutable, that's just inflaming things.\"We will robustly enforce up to the line of the law. We're going to be absolutely ruthless, and we have been, and you'll see many more arrests over the next week or so.\"Meanwhile, an education minister has said he agreed with the sentiment recently expressed by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem that London has a problem with antisemitism.Speaking on LBC, Robert Halfon, who is Jewish, warned it is a \"fearful time for Jews in the UK\", adding there is also a problem of \"ever-increasing incidents of antisemitism\" in universities.  After Mr Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the ongoing situation and its impact on communities in the UK, a Downing Street spokesman expressed concern at an increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.Speaking to reporters, the PM's spokesman described videos and pictures shared on social media over the weekend as \"extremely concerning\" and insisted that the government was working to reassure affected communities.Asked about calls for clarity on the definition of extremism, Downing Street said the government would look at any gaps in the law that might exist. \"It's important that frontline officers feel they have certainty and clarity,\" the spokesman added, but he also insisted that the police did have powers to act.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hello.bbclondon@bbc.co.ukIsrael's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.The mother of Shani Louk, an Israeli-German woman thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in Israel, says her daughter is dead.Speaking to German media, Ricarda Louk said she had been told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample taken from part of a skull bone proved to be Shani's. Her body has not yet been found. Shani's sister also confirmed the death on social media. Adi Louk wrote on Instagram on Monday that Shani had been killed in the \"massacre at Re'im\" - a reference to the attack staged by Hamas in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip, on 7 October.But it was not clear from the reports where or when the fragment of her skull had been found.Israel's foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was \"devastated\" to have to share the news of her death.The 22-year-old had been attending the festival near the Kibbutz Re'im when gunmen opened fire and sent terrified partygoers fleeing through the desert.More than 260 people were killed, the Israeli authorities said, while others were taken hostage.Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest).The woman was lying face down but Ms Louk's family say they identified her from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there was speculation online and in the media that she was dead, Ms Louk's mother said at the time she believed her daughter was alive. \"We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip,\" Ricarda Louk said in an appeal for information posted online. Speaking to the German TV news channel RTL/ntv on Monday, Ricarda Louk said she now assumed her daughter had been dead since 7 October and may have been shot in the head during the Hamas attack. \"At least she [Shani] didn't suffer,\" she said, adding that it was good to have certainty. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas, according to the Israeli authorities, but there has been a delay in identifying some people due to the poor condition of some of the bodies. More than 220 are thought to have been taken hostage and four people have been released.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.
