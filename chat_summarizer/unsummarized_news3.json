But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67248457", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DCEB/production/_131555565_f6125a0a3c27aa98fbf0d34919a3ad02616a2f1e0_0_5500_36671000x667.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and what is Hamas?", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal.

For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people.

So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67201107", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28B5/production/_131512401_6202af4965a6ddbbbfb267c202ccbfafb108f6d533_18_1224_6881224x688.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2827/production/_118597201_getty_shouting.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Gaza Strip in maps: Life in Gaza under siege", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal.

Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/45CF/production/_131517871_gettyimages-1718584683.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Could an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67084141", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F1A8/production/_131546816_7c9b7bdfb66539792eb3acf57bc32817a3e4ffe50_260_6000_33752000x1125-1.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israeli troops clear Gaza areas 'slice by slice', but is this an invasion?", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile.

And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life.

He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67205109", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/77D2/production/_131547603_qatar-index-getty.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Gaza hospital blast: What does new analysis tell us?", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop.

Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67216929", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DC20/production/_131525365_bbc_verify_al-ahli-hospital-2.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Jabalia refugee camp blast: Dozens reportedly killed in Gaza", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67276822", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14A75/production/_131579548_e9a1daad02dd1555d5a23b0b0652b4dc87e455de.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Antisemitic graffiti in Paris worries French leaders", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67274777", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/100AC/production/_131580756_gettyimages-1755808696.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Anti-war protesters interrupt Antony Blinken at US Senate hearing", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67269089", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/24A1/production/_131577390_69d1bf0782b8cd3b2247cddfe9a25b395047f34d.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israeli President Isaac Herzog defends Gaza operation", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67272441", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84D8/production/_131580043_hi088631496.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "\"Ceasefire now!\" Chanting protesters disrupt US Senate hearing", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67276907", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0gpxcjn.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Keir Starmer's Israel-Gaza comment 'hurt' Muslims - Anas Sarwar", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,\" he said.\"And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.\"In an interview with LBC on 11 October, Sir Keir was asked whether it was \"appropriate\" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza.\"I think that Israel does have that right,\" he said. \"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.\"A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force \"got it wrong\". Stephen Watson said he was \"very concerned\" about the footage and the force's professional standards department was looking into it.It comes as a relative of an Israeli man among the 239 hostages abducted by Hamas criticised the Metropolitan Police after posters were also removed in London.The Prestwich footage, which emerged on Monday night featuring a PCSO, was shared on social media, prompting widespread criticism. Mr Watson told BBC Radio Manchester there was \"no malicious intent\" but admitted the force had \"responded badly\".He said: \"It runs entirely contrary to the instructions that we have given to our officers in terms of dealing with this.\"There were a series of complaints about the posters and the PCSO, under instruction, removed the posters so there's nothing malicious in the intent of the officer. \"We have responded badly to a complaint and I think we've got it wrong.\"Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Israel has been taking military action in Gaza since the Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in southern Israel.The Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 8,000 people have been killed.In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said he shared the concerns about the posters' removal and confirmed an investigation was under way. \"The action taken last night, in response to complaints, is contrary to guidance that the force had already issued to staff in relation to flyposting,\" he said. \"We will continue to work with local authorities and the community to ensure posters can be displayed.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza.

We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically?

How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,\" he said.\"And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.\"In an interview with LBC on 11 October, Sir Keir was asked whether it was \"appropriate\" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza.\"I think that Israel does have that right,\" he said. \"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.\"A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force \"got it wrong\".

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,\" he said.\"And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.\"In an interview with LBC on 11 October, Sir Keir was asked whether it was \"appropriate\" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza.\"I think that Israel does have that right,\" he said. \"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.\"A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force \"got it wrong\". Stephen Watson said he was \"very concerned\" about the footage and the force's professional standards department was looking into it.It comes as a relative of an Israeli man among the 239 hostages abducted by Hamas criticised the Metropolitan Police after posters were also removed in London.The Prestwich footage, which emerged on Monday night featuring a PCSO, was shared on social media, prompting widespread criticism. Mr Watson told BBC Radio Manchester there was \"no malicious intent\" but admitted the force had \"responded badly\".He said: \"It runs entirely contrary to the instructions that we have given to our officers in terms of dealing with this.\"There were a series of complaints about the posters and the PCSO, under instruction, removed the posters so there's nothing malicious in the intent of the officer. \"We have responded badly to a complaint and I think we've got it wrong.\"Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Israel has been taking military action in Gaza since the Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in southern Israel.The Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 8,000 people have been killed.In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said he shared the concerns about the posters' removal and confirmed an investigation was under way. \"The action taken last night, in response to complaints, is contrary to guidance that the force had already issued to staff in relation to flyposting,\" he said. \"We will continue to work with local authorities and the community to ensure posters can be displayed.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67266873", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0647/production/_131570610_d37c29d9-a159-4e6b-81e9-993040012d0a.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza tells of 'terror' for family", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal.

And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service.

And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,\" he said.\"And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.\"In an interview with LBC on 11 October, Sir Keir was asked whether it was \"appropriate\" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza.\"I think that Israel does have that right,\" he said. \"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.\"A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force \"got it wrong\".

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67271759", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/755F/production/_131574003_gazaepa.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Israeli troops seen on the ground in Gaza", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates.

We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67271255", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0gptw65.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Moment injured Gaza girl, 5, sees baby sister is alive", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hello.bbclondon@bbc.co.uk\"The Jewish community at the moment is full of dread, full of fear, like I've never seen before,\" says Justin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News.He talks of this anxiety playing out with a backdrop of intense trauma caused by the Hamas killings and kidnappings on 7 October.More than 70% of British Jews have family living in Israel and 90% have visited the country at least once, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.But the fact the Metropolitan Police reported a 15-fold increase in antisemitic incidents over the past three weeks, when compared with the same period last year, means hatred has been at the forefront of the minds of many.\"If people who are so boiling over with rage in these demos see Jewish people as inextricably linked with Israel, they will inevitably target those Jewish people. The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67268584", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0gpt82j.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "What China wants from Israel-Hamas war", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted.

But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly.

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.

When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its Western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-67237146", "img_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F892/production/_131543636_gettyimages-1746793133.jpg", "error_code": "0"},{"title": "Reporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'", "content": "The calls come whenever he can get a signal.

So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry.

The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

They are being held in secret locations around the Gaza Strip. Among them are women, children and the elderly, as well as a number of soldiers.Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.News of Pte Megidish's release comes as Hamas released a video showing three hostages, all of them Israeli women. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the video as \"cruel propaganda\".Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to \"change the Middle East.\" Joe Biden has said there's \"no going back.\" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved.\"You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,\" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun.\"You need to do it right now,\" he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear.\"There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,\" one told me.  \"You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMilitary plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes.\"I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,\" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase.\"It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that.\"A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"De-Baathification\", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. \"I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,\" Dr Milshtein says. \"For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen.\"Palestinians agree. \"Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,\" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. \"If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza.\"That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948.\"Fleeing means a one-way ticket,\" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. \"It doesn't mean coming back.\"Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza.\"They should cross the border to Egypt,\" he says, \"temporarily or permanently.\"Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: \"This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs.\"To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined \"safe areas\" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be \"an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to\u2026 migrate to Egypt.\"Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?\"That's the million dollar question,\" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means \"riding in on the back of an Israeli tank\".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives.\"People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,\" she says.\"You might find a few collaborators,\" she says, \"but the Gazans will not take kindly to them.\"Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were \"on the other side of the street,\" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price.\"I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home.\"Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely.\"It's like a bone in our throat.\"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,500 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that he had set \"the clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities\", as well as freeing the hostages. Later, he rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying they were \"calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas\".\"This is a time for war - a war for our common future,\" he added.On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers had \"killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops\". The IDF also said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air. It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building \"with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside\". An Israeli tank was seen near Gaza City, on the main road to the south of the Gaza Strip.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military had again warned that the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City should be evacuated, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there. Eyewitnesses described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering. On Monday, Hamas published a video showing three women held hostage in Gaza, one of whom berated Mr Netanyahu and called on him to agree to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for them.The video was clearly recorded in circumstances of extreme duress and Mr Netanyahu condemned it as \"cruel psychological propaganda\".Later, the IDF said it had rescued a female soldier during an overnight ground operation.The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses \"taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies\".The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies. Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, as well as the sewerage system.Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas has hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.The Israeli military ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south. The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million since the latest conflict began. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.Hamas's capture of hostages was thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 5,100 Palestinians who held in Israeli prisons at the start of the month.The Israeli military says at least 240 people are still being held in Gaza. Theseinclude 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken.Hamas has so far released for hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. On 20 October, two American-Israeli hostages - mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan - were freed. Four days later, two elderly Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz, were released. On Monday,Israel's military said its soldier Pte Ori Megidish had been rescued during ground operations in Gaza on Sunday night. Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.  Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders. It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would \"pay an unprecedented price\".Given the significant resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland. Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas. It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a \"complete siege\" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this \"humanitarian for humanitarian\".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysRosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (\"mowing the grass\" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: \"Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.\"Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified \"Western position\" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.\"Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11\" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says 230 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation. Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.Israel's borders explained in mapsIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugeesWhether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removedWhether the two sides should share JerusalemAnd - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside IsraelIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called \"the deal of the century\" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.\"Every Hamas member is a dead man,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after its gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel. He later vowed Hamas's \"terror machine\" and political structure would be dismantled.Israel has said it is expanding its ground operations in Gaza to achieve its aims. Once it is satisfied Hamas is defeated, its stated aim is to disengage from Gaza completely. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks of a \"new security regime\" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But are its aims realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 239 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.\"I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,\" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. \"But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.\"Weakening it might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. An IDF spokesman said the main aim was that Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to \"threaten or kill Israeli civilians\".Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees that destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. Ultimately, the defence minister said the next 75 years of Israel's existence was to a large degree dependent on the outcome of this war.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces. In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City. That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with a rising death toll, supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.\"The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',\" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount as civilian casualties continue to rise.\"It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,\" says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF had a straightforward choice, either sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to \"do Hamas as much harm as possible\".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Is there a plan for after the war ends?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhat could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point, with only limited quantities of aid getting into Gaza. Foreign nationals and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting to leave.\"The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,\" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has warned that any attempt to move Gazans into the Sinai peninsula would prompt Egyptians to \"go out and protest in their millions\".Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a \"red line\" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: \"No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but although communities on both sides have been evacuated, so far the violence does not amount to a new front against Israel. Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch \"new fronts\" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!\"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force. US President Joe Biden says \"it would be a big mistake\".A power vacuum would also create very serious risks and Mr Milstein warns the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. The international community might provide an interim solution, as it did when the UN ran Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, but the UN is widely mistrusted in Israel.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Mr Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a \"demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now\".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on \"dual-use goods\" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about \"payback\". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. \"It's bad optics for them,\" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Giving birth amid shelling and power cutsThen there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.Nine days after the explosion at the car park of Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, the exact cause of the blast is still contested.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza accused Israel of hitting the hospital with an air strike. Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on \"overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information\". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened.It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater.But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. \"The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporised. Nothing is left,\" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: \"In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza.\" The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an \"air burst\" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned.There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground. We know this is the site of the hospital. This clip has now been repeatedly analysed in an attempt to answer two key questions - what exactly was the projectile seen rising into the sky and could it have hit the hospital.Open-source analysts including Oliver Alexander and Aric Toler and his team at the New York Times have cast doubt on whether the explosion in the sky shown in the Al Jazeera clip is related to the blast at the hospital.Their analysis places the mid-air explosion some 3.2km (2 miles) away from the hospital, closer to the Gaza-Israel border.In other words, they believe another projectile - not seen in the video - caused the deadly explosion, but they do not know what that was.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictBowen: Has the invasion begun?Hostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?It has also been disputed whether the mid-air explosion seen in that video is a malfunctioning rocket as Israeli authorities and others have said. Some have suggested it shows a rocket being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system.However, several experts we spoke to said that the explosion in the sky isn't consistent with what is usually expected following an Iron Dome intercept.\"About one second before the explosion there appears a 'comet trail' of burning particles behind the rocket - probably pieces of disintegrating propellant grain. After the explosion there is an elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds. This is not typical to Tamir [Iron Dome] interception, where the Tamir's warhead explodes causing an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead,\" says Dr Uzi Rubin, an Israeli defence analyst at Rusi, who was the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization.We asked a number of other experts.\"The projectile does not have the flight path of Iron Dome. Additionally, Iron Dome almost never deploys just one interceptor,\" Mr Gannon says.However, Mr Garlasco said he believed the footage was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that Iron Dome interceptions only happen over Israeli territory.CCTV, amateur footage, and feeds from Al Jazeera and Israel's Channel 12 show that, in the minute before the hospital blast, there were at least two separate bursts of rockets in the area.Analysts have emphasised that the most important thing in investigations like this is allowing independent investigators access to the site, to any physical evidence that has been collected and the ability to interview survivors. That has not happened so far and is never easy in war zones.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer, Benedict Garman, Paul Brown, Jemimah Herd, Tural Ahmedzade, Emma Pengelly, Alex Murray and Jamie Ryan.Dozens of people are reported to have been killed by a huge explosion at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded by an Israeli air strike, which it denounced as a \"horrific massacre\".Pictures showed people climbing through several large craters and searching for survivors inside wrecked buildings.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been bombarding Gaza for three weeks.Earlier, the military said its ground forces were engaged in \"fierce battles\" with Hamas fighters deep inside the Gaza Strip and had killed dozens of them when it attacked an outpost in the north. Hamas said its fighters had been using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns against the advancing troops.Israel has said it is the \"second phase\" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Tuesday's explosion in Jabalia reportedly destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the densely populated camp.AFP news agency reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A vast column of black smoke was clearly visible from inside Israel at about the time the first reports came in. One weapons expert said the largest crater was consistent with those caused by the sorts of bombs the Israeli air force was using to hit targets buried deep underground. Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was \"an earthquake\". \"I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,\" he told AFP.The medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia, also said it had received dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded people.One of the doctors, Subaib Idais, told Reuters news agency: \"They were just in their homes, they were targeted while they were in their homes... All martyrs, children, women, elderly.\"\"We have no idea what to do. There are injured everywhere. All the volunteers went down hand-in-hand just to help people,\" he added.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?Jabalia is the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps. It is located in the north of Gaza City, and before the war its 116,000 registered residents lived in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).It has been hit repeatedly since Israel's bombing campaign began in response to Hamas's attack.It is not clear how many people have fled the camp since then, but the pictures of hundreds searching in the rubble for bodies suggest that many remain.On 13 October, the Israeli military ordered the 1.1 million people living in Jabalia and all other parts of northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety, as it stepped up air and artillery strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in preparation for the ground offensive.However, hundreds of thousands are believed not to have heeded the order. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools, churches and other public buildings.Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said \"recall the 1930s\".Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. \"I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,\" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. \"I can't understand it.\"In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts \"recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews\". Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. \"Antisemitism continues to kill,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said. \"We will never give up the fight.\"Separately, a woman was critically injured after being shot by police on Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were accompanied by inscriptions such as \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will win\". The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the \"antisemitic and racist\" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed \"disgraceful acts\". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of \"importing\" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France.About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled \"Ceasefire now!\"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are testifying about the White House's $106bn (\u00a387.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading \"No to the siege of Gaza\", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red \"to symbolise blood\", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and \"the passions expressed in this room\" at the end of his statement.\"All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,\" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:$61.4bn for Ukraine's defence$9.2bn for humanitarian assistance$2bn for Indo-Pacific security$10.9bn for southern border security and migrant issuesAs support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected House Speaker, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is unattached from the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would \"say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents\".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to \"help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes\".\"Politicising our national security interests is a nonstarter,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his \"political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans\".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictThe White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas' 7 October attack, despite Mr Biden and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political differences sometimes straining the ties between the two countries.\"We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,\" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel said Hamas' incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October has killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombardment began.A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for \"humanitarian reasons\", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. \"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,\" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. \"Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness.\"The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an \"overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs\".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been \"working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas\". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the \"correct position\" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach\".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as \"deeply offensive\" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Analysis: Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceKeir Starmer walks political tightrope on GazaFollowing his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an \"alleviation of this awful situation\" and that he would \"engage sensitively\" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians \"caught in the crossfire\". \"While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now.\"Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.\"He said a humanitarian pause was \"the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be \"unwise\" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and \"any peace loving citizen\". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: \"I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire.\"Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"fine words\" adding: \"The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. \"Those calls will only get louder.\"Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: \"I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now.\"Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show \"the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs\".They said calls for a pause were \"vague and unclear\" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictOn Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\"He said his words were intended as \"a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings\" in the region.But the phrase \"between the river and the sea\" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend \"were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety\".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting \"a huge focus\" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting \"a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities\".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw \"terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us\".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  \"We listen and we respect them,\" he said, but added that \"first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens\". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it \"couldn't be measured in numbers\".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that \"only a trickle\" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned \"no place was safe in Gaza\". \"Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,\" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  \"We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out.\"  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictTurning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as \"the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life\". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. \"My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,\" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. \"Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward.\" \"This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?\" Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar has said some of Sir Keir Starmer's remarks about Israel have \"hurt\" Muslims and all \"peace-loving\" people.The UK party chief was attacked after he seemed to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza. He has resisted pressure from within his party to call for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pause\" to allow aid into Gaza.Mr Sarwar said he wanted to go \"further\" and supported a ceasefire.Starmer to set out Gaza policy amid Labour tensionsLabour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceFifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyHe also called for the immediate release of hostages, an increase in humanitarian aid and a \"meaningful\" peace process.  \"We need to see peace and we need to see the protection of life and we need to see the following of international law,\" Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland News.\"That's not currently happening. We're having the slaughtering of innocent individuals every day which is completely unacceptable.\"He said Sir Keir had \"clarified\" his comments, made to LBC on 11 October.The Scottish Labour leader said the comments caused \"a lot of anguish, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain\" after spreading like \"wildfire\" on social media. \"I think it's important so say not just to Muslim communities but any peace-loving citizen across the country,\" he added. More than 50 Labour MPs and 250 councillors have also backed a ceasefire, with about 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war.Sir Keir has instead called for a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and people out of the war zone.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHamas would be \"emboldened\" by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, Sir Keir claimed.He said a humanitarian pause was the \"only credible approach\", which could see \"the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering\".\"Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,\" he said.\"And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.\"In an interview with LBC on 11 October, Sir Keir was asked whether it was \"appropriate\" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza.\"I think that Israel does have that right,\" he said. \"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.\"A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force \"got it wrong\".

There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,\" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but \"we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating\".Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were \"silencing\" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. \"For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,\" he added. \"Even if there was a legitimate reason to take them down, it's not the job of the police to do that.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The fears are never-ending at this point,\" says Mr Cohen.Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupThe demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for \"intifada\", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.\"We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,\" says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.\"It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,\" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.\"Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,\" he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.\"The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,\" he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to \"the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice\".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.\"There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,\" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.\"It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,\" Mr Sayle says.Referring to the \"river to the sea\" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.\"I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,\" Mr Sayle says.\"But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,\" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictWhile there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.\"We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,\" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.\"Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,\" Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with \"This message has been deleted.\" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - \"Are you good?\" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he \"loved most in his life\".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.\"Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,\" Mr Alnaouq said. \"Then they bombed it.\"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'                                                              'Oh god, they're here': Hamas massacre captured on Israeli mothers' WhatsApp groupAhmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.\"I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.\"Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictFor Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.\"Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,\" he said. \"But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.\"He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. \"So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.\" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. I wonder when I'll next have water, says Manchester scientist, Mohammed GhalayiniAside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is \"starting to break down\". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his \"last seen\" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. \"It's all part of being Palestinian,\" she explains. \"Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.\"But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, \"Yes, they're safe.\" \"I have to,\" she said. \"She'll just get worried.\"Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.\"We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.\"There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the \"Israel-Hamas war\".\"It's heavily misleading,\" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - \"none of them affiliated with Hamas\". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem \"justified and targeted\".\"We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,\" he said. \"I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. \"Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?\"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an \"echo chamber\", she said the marches help her feel \"reassured\".\"It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.\" A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was \"murdered with her whole family\", including five children.\"Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,\" he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel \"left alone\" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in \"close contact\" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was \"terrified\" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Welsh party leaders call for Middle East peaceStories from Israel and Gaza horrifying - DrakefordMore than third of Senedd calls for Gaza ceasefireIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Some Gazans return to north despite risks, UN saysThe doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became \"trapped\".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was \"the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing\".\"It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary.\"The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in.\"We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,\" the doctor said.\"For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children\". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe.\"Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,\" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear.\"In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed.\"Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board.\"They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,\" he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \"on the second day to get some help\" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him \"to go online and fill a form\".\"I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,\" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to allow aid in, amid an \"imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes\".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza \"can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible\". It added: \"FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to \"urge calm\" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it \"stands ready to strengthen communication with China\" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. \"Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.\"But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. \"China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.Follow live: Latest updatesWatch: Israel's UN envoy pins yellow star to chestReporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind camera I just stand and cry'Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictChina's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed \"deep disappointment\" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that \"all countries have the right to self-defence\" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone \"beyond the scope of self-defence\".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that \"standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South\", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.How far would US go to defend Israel?Belt and Road: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it? Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is \"ginning up the nationalist response\u2026 tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,\" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of \"adding fuel to the fire\" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its Western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that \"by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,\" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has \"no selfish interests on the Palestinian question\". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. \"As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,\" he says, \"sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.\"Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. \"I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,\" he tells me, \"but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.\" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. \"This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,\" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. \"We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.\"In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.\"I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,\" she says. \"He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. \"He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.\"Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.
